# Autocorrecting-Typing-Software

In this project, I designed a program that measures typing speed and a user can compete with other players through the multiplayer feature. 
In addition, I also implemented autocorrect, which is a feature that attempts to correct the spelling of a word after a user types it based on probability. 
This project is inspired by typeracer.
